<h1>FAQs</h1>

<p><strong>Where does your data come from?</strong><br>
We compile a hand-curated list drawn from public sources: press reports, FOI releases, and corroborating evidence posted online (reviews, social-media images, local news, reader submissions). Each entry is cross-checked against multiple independent clues before itâ€™s added to the map.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have inside information?</strong><br>
We receive communications from contributors whose identities and sources are protected under GDPR and other data-protection regulations. We neither confirm nor deny specific sources.</p>

<p><strong>When is my nearest protest?</strong><br>
At the moment we are focused on compiling the most accurate hotel data. We are not involved in the organisation of any protests, but we are happy to pass on details of organised, peaceful protests if asked.</p>

<p><strong>Can I submit new locations?</strong><br>
Yes, via the contact form. If possible, please include supporting evidence.</p>
