  This privacy policy outlines how howfarfrommydoorstep handles your data. We are committed to ensuring your privacy and comply with applicable data-protection laws.

  <p><strong>2. Data Collection</strong><br>
  <strong>OpenStreetMap (OSM)</strong>: We use OSM for mapping functions. OSM does not store personal data for map embeddings or queries made through our site.<br>

  <strong>Contact Form</strong>: We also collect personal information, such as your name and email address, when you use our contact form. This information is sent directly to our email for response purposes and is not stored on the website itself. If you choose to submit anonymously, you may use fake details for your name and email. This option is provided to ensure your privacy when you prefer not to share personal information.</p>

  Data collected by Google Analytics might be shared with Google, subject to their privacy policies. We do not share this data with other third parties.</p>

  <p><strong>6. Retention</strong><br>

  <strong>Contact-Form Data</strong>: Data sent via our contact form will be retained only as long as necessary for the purpose of communication, after which it will be securely deleted unless there's a legal obligation to retain it.</p>

  Under applicable laws, you have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal data held by us or by Google through Analytics if identifiable. You have the right to request data portability, object to processing, restrict processing, and not be subject to automated decision-making, including profiling. To exercise these rights, please contact us using the details provided. Please note that if you submit data anonymously or with fake details, some rights under data-protection laws might not be applicable since the data cannot be identified as pertaining to you.</p>
